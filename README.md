# FarmBuddy 🌾

**AI-Powered Multimodal Agricultural Companion for Smallholder Farmers**

## 📖 Overview

FarmBuddy is an intelligent advisory platform designed to assist smallholder farmers in Nigeria (and beyond) by providing real-time, context-aware agricultural advice. It bridges the gap between complex agricultural data and farmers through accessible interfaces like voice interaction and image analysis.

The system leverages **Google's Gemini AI** for reasoning and **OpenWeatherMap** for localized weather data to offer personalized recommendations.

*   **🌦️ Weather Integration:** Real-time weather updates and 5-day forecasts to inform planting and harvesting decisions.
*   **🌓 Dark Mode:** Eye-friendly optional dark theme for low-light conditions.
*   **📱 Responsive Design:** Optimized for mobile devices and low-bandwidth connections.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** Python, Django
*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
